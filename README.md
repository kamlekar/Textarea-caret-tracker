Textarea-caret-tracker
======================

It is used to track the caret position in Text area. This is useful mostly to have a suggestion box just below the caret position.

This is actually idea of user [Mathijs Flietstra](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1846192/) on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16575647/1577396).
